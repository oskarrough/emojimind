# Emojimind

A variant of the classic Mastermind board game and a JavaScript implementation. Only this time you are free to use your emoji of choice.

The idea is to have an interface to implement Mastermind in any form. In this repo you'll find both the emojimind.js and an example implementation in Vue.js.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement mastermind logic
- [x] Vue.js implementation
- [ ] Customizable emojis
- [ ] Use something like pouchdb to save progress

## Development

- `yarn dev` starts a local server and recompiles the app as you work
- `yarn build` builds `src/index.js` to `dist/bundle.js` - also see rollup.config.js

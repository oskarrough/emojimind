# Emojimind

A variant of the classic Mastermind board game for the web. Only this time you are free to use your emoji of choice.

The idea is to have an interface to implement Mastermind in any form. In this repo you'll find both:

- `src/emojimind.js` (methods to create your own mastermind game)
- `src/index.js` (an example implementation in Vue.js)

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement mastermind logic
- [x] Vue.js implementation
- [ ] Customizable emojis
- [ ] Use something like pouchdb to save progress

## Development

- `yarn start` — starts a local server that reloads as you work

To deploy, upload the `src` folder to any static web host.
Netlify is configured to automatically deploy the `master` branch to https://emojimind.oskarrough.com.

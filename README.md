# Emojimind

A variant of the classic Mastermind board game for the web. Only this time you are free to use your emoji of choice.

The idea is to have an interface to implement Mastermind in any form. In this repo you'll find both:

- src/emojimind.js (methods to create your own mastermind game)
- src/index.js (an example implementation in Vue.js)

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement mastermind logic
- [x] Vue.js implementation
- [ ] Customizable emojis
- [ ] Use something like pouchdb to save progress

## Development

- `yarn start` starts a local server that reloads as you work
- deploy the `src` folder to any static web hostr
